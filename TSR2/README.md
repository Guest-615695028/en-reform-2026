# A Proposal on English Writing Reform - Traditional Spelling Revision 2.0
Long has it been wondered if the Ingglish tung will fall internationally when the United Kingdom and States break down, as the Russian tung fell shortly after the downbroken Soviet Union. If so, the Ingglish will fall quicklier than Russian as the inconsistency of spelling-to-pronunciation metes ~20% in the former but only sparingly in the latter. In 1908 was the [Ingglish Spelling Society](https://www.spellingsociety.org/) founded, but long unseen under the Five Eyes that only watch forrin ships.

In 1828 mended Noah Webster Ingglish spellings in the United States, such as _flavor_ for _flavour_, _fiber_ for _fibre_, _defense_ for _defence_, _analyze_ for _analyse_, and _catalog_ for _catalogue_.

In 1920, the Simplify Spelling Board published a self-shoïng Handbook of Simplified Spelling with three parts:
- Part 1 narrates an outline of the history of Ingglish spelling and the reforming attempts until 1920.
- Part 2 presents the arguments in favor of reform and replies to the objections that are commonly made.
- Part 3 contains the SSB's proposed rules for simplified spelling and a list of the words that would be changed by them.

Planning a "stepwise" reform, it noted that spelling should be chandged, most of which are originally the overt act of a lone writer folloed at first by minority. Thus, people are hartened to "point the way" and "set the example" by writing the reformed spellings as the handbook set forth ([confer Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Spelling_Board)).

In 2021 is there allso a proposition named [Traditional Spelling Revised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Spelling_Revised), sponsored and afforded by Ingglish Spelling Society, with a degree of support and publicity reviewed in March 2025.

## THE PRINCIPAL RULES OF TSR 2.0
1. Stressed vowels `V` are usually long in `VCV`, but short in `VCC|VC$|iCi`, as usual in TS:
   - pan / pane, set / scene, snip / snipe, rot / rote, run / rune; ("Magic E")
   - sad / sadist, set / scenic, bit / biter, cut / cuticle;
   - fat / fate / fatter, pet / pete / petting, bit / bite / bitter, rot / rote / rotten; ("Twicing rule")
   - lipid, licit, limit; icecle _- icicle;
   * BUT where the second I is part of the suffix _ing_, the first I is usually long as in _pining_, _wining_. In these cases, twice the consonant to keep short the first vowel: _winning_, _livving_.
2. Consonant twicing without misleading the pronunciation is not allways chandged in TSR2.
3. The combination _al(l)_ is one of the most difficult areas to attempt codication of the underlying rules of TS. However, the folloïng rules are watertight.
   - For the most part, _al_ and _all_ represent the sounds `{l` as in _algebra_ and _allergy_. However, in TS can they allso represent the sound `O:l`. Usually is this sound forstwd by _au_ or _aw_ as in  _laud_ or _paw_, but the sound can allso be forstwd by _al_ as in _always_ or _all_ as in _small_. Such cases occur:
   - In a few common words beginning with _al_ givving a meaning of totality is forstwd the sound /O:l/, those are, _albeit_, _almighty_, _almost_, _already_, _alright_, _also_, _although_, _altogether_, _always_. These AL's becumm _all_ in TSR2, i.e. _all-be-it_, _allmighty_, _allmost_, _allreddy_, _allright_, _allso_, _all-though_, _alltogether_, _allways_, with no hyphen needed since _all_ is written before a consonant without ambiguation.
   - Where _all_ is stressed ending or before a consonant (but W, Y), the sound `O:l` is allso forstwd, e.g.
      - _ball_, _call_, _fall_, _small_, and others;
      - _balls_, _callst_, _falls_, and others;
   - If the _all_ is folloed by a vowel are they written _awl_, like _cawled_, _fawling_, and _smawler_.
   - See section "Sub-rules" for _-ald-_, _-alk-_ and _-alt-_.
4. The letter G: usually represents the sound `g` as in _gun_, along with the sound `dZ` before the letters E, I or Y. Exceptions to this rule are often marked in TS by inserting an U as in _guide_ and TSR folloes this practice. Therefore, the word _argue_ is written as _argüe_ with diëresis.
   - _gg_ allways represents the sound `g` in TSR. It can therefore be used instead of _u_ to preserve the `g` sound against succeeding vowels that would otherwise turn it to `dZ`  (e.g. _lingger_, _longger_). It is particularly relevant for exceptions to the _ange_ sub-group where the sound is short rather than long (e.g. bangger_, hangger_). See D4 below.
   - In cases where the sound is `dZ` but it is still necessary to keep the preceding vowel short, TSR inserts a _d_ before the _g_ as in _badger_, _lodger_, _fudge_ and others. Where _gu_ represents `gw` it is edspelt - _langwage_.
5. The Letter S: It normally represents the sound `s` as in _sound_, but allso `z` as in _please_.
   - Based on TS formulae, S represents `s`:
      - At the beginning of words: _snake_;
      - After hyphenable point: _homesick_, _ransack_;
      - After a voiceless consonant: _clicks, cliffs, clips, its_;
      - In the prefixes _dis_ and _mis_, whose S may be voiced by the consonant after.
      - After the prefixes _con_ and _per_: _consent_, _persistent_;
   - Where the above rules can not be applied, _s_ is often twiced in TS to retain the `s` sound: _miss, mass, missing_. TSR2 dus not change this, but ones in which a TS spelling cannot be brought within the rule above, e.g. _dizease_, _mizzerble_ (the twice _zz_ is required to keep the stressed vowel short – using _s_ would make the _i_ long). But _miser_. In TSR, some prefixes may be hyphenated to ensure predictability of the `s` sound: _re-send_, _co-signatory_.
6. The letter X: For the purposes of Magic E and twicing, TSR2 treats X as two letters _ks_ and dus not twice it, so the leading vowels are allways short, e.g. _boxing_, _sexual_.
7. The combination OW: In old spelling can this represent two sounds `oU` as in _crow_ and `aU` as in _gown_. To avoid confusion, TSR2 sees _ow_ only for the sound `aU`. Where such cases arise in TS, they becumm O/OE when ending a root: _floe_ (flow), _sloe_ (slow). In uther cases, _oa_ is seen where the sound is `oU` and the word has to be respelled for uther reasons: _soal_ (_soul_ in TS).
8. The combination TH - `T` and `D`: In TS, both sounds are forstwd by the combination _th_. TSR continues to use this single grapheme for both phonemes. However, the folloïng rules help to choose what it sounds.
   - by default _th_ represents the sound `T` as in _thin_, _thanks_, _thimble_;
   - _th_ represents `D` in
      - ending "-the":  _lathe_, _bathe_, _seethe_, _loathe_; 
      - words containing "-ther": _other_, _brother_, and others.
      - the word or prefix "with", which may be devoiced before a voiceless consonant.
   - Beginning _th_ allso represents `D` in and only in the folloing roots:
      - Personal pronouns: _thou_ (_thee_, _thy_, _thine_), _they_ (_them_, _their/s_)
      - Demonstratives: _the_, _that_, _then(ce)_, _there_, _these_, _this_, _those_
      - Others: _than_, _thus_
9. The suffix _-ed_, as in TS, is normally added at the end of a word to indicate passive mood or past tense: _sifted_, _gifted_.
10. The suffixes _-s_ and _-es_, as in TS, are normally added at the end of a word to indicate plural or third-person singular present indicative: _dishes_, _flips_, _sits_, _kicks_. TS _give_ is re-spelled _giv_ in TSR – so _givs_ plural.
11. Some TS digraphs can represent one sound or two separate sounds, such as _ea_, _ie_; if two, the latter has a diëresis, like the verb to _creäte_.
12. _sc_ folloes the rules for the pronunciation of _c_: _scam_, _scene_, _scythe_;
13. _sch_ normally represents `sk` as in _school_; in some words, largely of German origin, the combination represents `S` as in schmaltz, but these can be treated as loanwords and italicized;
14. schwa - TSR generally retains the TS spelling for unaccented syllables, except where the TS combination is itself irregular; thus: _about_, _ensnare_, _intelligent_, _common_, _upon_. We write _forren_ insted of _foreign_; the key here is to pronounce the word carefully at dictation speed; if the sound of the unaccented syllable is not what the letters predict, then respelling may be necessary.
15. _-our_ (as a suffix) adopts American conventions i.e. _or_ as in _labor_, _savior_, and others.
16. suffix _-ous_ is unchanged - `@s` e.g. _famous_.

## Special rules for TSR 2.0
1. The folloing very common words keep their original and irregular spelling, along with the said voiced-th words in Principal Rule 7.
   1. Personal pronouns and adjectives: _you(r)(s)_.
   2. Parts of the vebs to be and to have: _are_,_was_,_were_,_have_,_having_
   3. Small numbers: _one(th)_, _once_, _two(th)_;
   4. Interrogatives: _what_, _where_, _who_, _whose_;
   5. Indefinitives: _any(one/thing)_, _(n)either_, _every_, _none_, _nothing_, _some(one/thing)_,
   6. Others: _eye_, _with_, _woman_, _women_.
   - The formal second-person pronoun "you" may also be represented in TSR by a capital U. 
2. Common Suffixes: A number of common word endings doo not comply fully with the normal rules of TS but can usually be relied on to represent particular sounds; these are retained in their original spelling.
   - Those involving the /S/ sound 
      - C: -cean (ocean), -cial (facial, special, official), -cian (musician), -cient (prescient), -cience (conscience), -cion (suspicion), -cious (spacious, specious, meretricious, atrocious). 
      - SS: -ssion (passion, confession, mission) 
      - T: -tial (partial), -tient (patient), -tience (patience), -tion (nation, depletion, ignition, lotion, solution).
   - Those involving the /Z/ sound 
      - S: -sion (invasion, adhesion, elision, explosion, confusion), -sure (embrasure, pleasure, composure), -sual (casual).
      - Z: -zure (azure)
   - The Magic E and Doubling Rules apply generally to the above suffixes. Thus _ignition_, unlike the uther examples, dus not lengthen the first _i_. 
Similarly, the suffix _-ssion_ dus not lengthen the preceding vowel because of the doubling of S. TSR uses _ssion_ instead of -tion when the preceding vowel is stressed, but needs to be kept short; thus are there _nation_ but _nassional_; _special_ becomes _spessial_, _pleasure_ becomes _plezzure_. The combination _-cious_ observes the Magic E and Doubling Rules, so _precious_ becoumes _prescious_.

3. Uther common combinations:
   - A as AW: -all (all, ball)
   - Long A: -ange- (danger, angel), -aste (taste, waste)
   - Long I: -ign- (benign, sign)
   - Long O: -old (old, gold, intechandging with `{ld`), -olt (bolt `{lt`), -orce (force, divorce `O:r\s`), -orne (borne `O:r\n`)
   - Others: -ould (could, would), war- (warm, warn), wor- (worm, worst).
   - The combination _-le_ after a consonant at the end of a word produces the sound `@l` as in _-able_, _ible_, _iple_ and so on. The Magic E and doubling rules apply as if the preceding consonant and _l_ were a single letter. Thus: _apple_ (vowel short); _table_ (vowel long); also _ible_; thus _risible_ but _Bible_; _noble_ but _nobble_.

## Added punctuations in TSR 2.0
Diëresis (¨): seperate the vowel (ä, ë, ï, ö, ü, ÿ) from the folloed letter.
Accent mark(´), Second accent mark(`): optional accent marks, used if they are not at the first place.
